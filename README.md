# Dotfiles

dotfiles for my i3 + lemonbar setup on ArchLinux

I use this configuration for my laptop which runs **[i3-gaps window manager](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)** (a fork of i3) on
**[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)**.
Ideas mostly <del>stolen</del> copied from others and modified to fit my use, I have acknowledged some but if I'm using parts or all of your config, **THANKS!**.

## Dependencies

*Note: I hope I've covered all dependencies here, but something might be missing*

This setup is intended for **[i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)** by Airblader. I haven't tested it with regular i3-- you'll probably have to make a few changes if you want to use that. Only tested on ArchLinux-- I can't make any guarantees about its compatibility with other distros.

## General

1. First, install the dependencies listed in the section above.

2. `bin/` contains custom scripts. Add them to your `$PATH` and ensure that they are executable.

3. My default shell is zsh and I use the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework to manage my zsh configuration.

4. You need to have [gnupg](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/gnupg/) installed and configured properly for [pass](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/pass/) to work.

5. [Colorscheme](/Xresources.d/wal/colors.Xresources) is auto-generated using `pywal`which can be installed from the [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-pywal/) or through pip.

6. I made some modifications to my i3+dmenu, vim, and lemonbar configs to make them use the colors generated by [wal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). See the [wal wiki](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki) for more customization options.

7. Some of the [wallpapers](/Xresources.d/wallpapers) were downloaded from [facets](http://www.facets.la/) &copy; by Justin Maller
